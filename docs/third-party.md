# Third Party Software

The DTaaS platform uses a range of third-party software components.
Each component remains subject to its upstream licence terms.

## Deployment and Runtime Software

The core deployment stack currently references the following software:

## Development Environments

In addition to runtime software, the development and documentation workflows
use the following tools.

| Software Package                                                    | Usage     | Licence                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)                                    | mandatory | [Node.js licence](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/LICENSE) |
| [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)                                       | mandatory | Artistic Licence 2.0                                                |
| [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)                                        | optional  | BSD 2-Clause                                                        |
| [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) | mandatory | MIT                                                                 |

| [MicroK8s](https://github.com/canonical/microk8s)                   | optional  | Apache 2.0                                                          |

## Client Packages With Copyleft Terms

Most client dependencies are permissively licensed and are declared in
`client/package.json`. Two are named here because their terms carry obligations
that a redistributor has to meet, and a name in a lock file is not a notice.

| Software Package                                                                                   | Usage     | Licence                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------- |
| [@into-cps-association/bim-example](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/dtaas-sdk/tree/main/examples/bim) | mandatory | INTO-CPS Association Public Licence |
| [web-ifc](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc)                                              | mandatory | MPL 2.0                             |

`web-ifc` is the IFC geometry kernel, and it reaches the client through the
`bim` extension (`bim-example`, vendored from dtaas-sdk as described in
[Client Extensions](developer/client-sdk.md)), which embeds its WebAssembly
build so that a deployment serves no extra file. Embedding it does not change
its terms.

MPL 2.0 is file-level copyleft and is compatible with redistributing DTaaS under
the INTO-CPS Licence. What it requires of anyone shipping a build:

- **The source of the MPL-covered files has to be available** to whoever
  receives that build. Upstream is linked above, and the version in use is the
  one `client/yarn.lock` resolves for `web-ifc`.
- **The notice has to travel with the artifact.** Embedding the kernel inside a
  JavaScript chunk makes its provenance invisible in the built output, which is
  the reason this table exists instead of a pointer to `package.json`.
- **A modified MPL file stays MPL.** `bim-example` uses `web-ifc` as a dependency and
  does not fork it, so the boundary is the package boundary.

## Package Dependencies

Additional third-party dependencies for client, servers, CLI, and tooling are
declared in:

- `client/package.json`
- `servers/**/package.json`
- `cli/pyproject.toml`
- `deploy/services/cli/pyproject.toml`
- `script/docs/mkdocs-requirements.txt`

Upstream dependency licences should be consulted in those manifests when
detailed licence auditing is required.
