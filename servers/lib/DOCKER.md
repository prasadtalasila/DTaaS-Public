# Overview

The **libms microservice** is a simplified file manager providing graphQL API.
It has two features:

* provide a listing of directory contents.
* transfer a file to user.

## Use in Docker Environment

### Create Docker Compose File

Create an empty file named `compose.lib.yml` and copy
the following into the file:

```yml
services:
  libms:
    image: intocps/libms:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./files:/dtaas/libms/files
    ports:
      - "4001:4001"
```

### Create Files Directory

The **libms microservice** serves files available from
`files` directory.
So, create a directory named `files` with the following structure:

```text
files/
  data/
  digital_twins/
  functions/
  models/
  tools/
  common/
    data/
    functions/
    models/
    tools/
```

Please create this `files` directory
in the same file system location as that of the `compose.lib.yml` file.

### Run

Use the following commands to start and stop the container respectively:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.lib.yml up -d
docker compose -f compose.lib.yml down
```

The lib microservice website will become available at <http://localhost:4001>.

## Application Programming Interface (API)

The lib microservice application provides services at
two end points:

### HTTP protocol

**URL:** `localhost:4001/lib/files`

The regular file upload and download options become available
via web browser.

### GraphQL protocol

**URL:** `localhost:4001/lib`

<summary>GraphQL API details</summary>
The lib microservice takes two distinct GraphQL queries.

#### Directory Listing

This query receives directory path and provides list of files
in that directory. A sample query and response are given here.

``` graphql
query {
  listDirectory(path: ".") {
    repository {
      tree {
        blobs {
          edges {
            node {
              name
              type
            }
          }
        }
        trees {
          edges {
            node {
              name
              type
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

``` graphql
{
  "data": {
    "listDirectory": {
      "repository": {
        "tree": {
          "blobs": {
            "edges": []
          },
          "trees": {
            "edges": [
              {
                "node": {
                  "name": "common",
                  "type": "tree"
                }
              },
              {
                "node": {
                  "name": "data",
                  "type": "tree"
                }
              },
              {
                "node": {
                  "name": "digital twins",
                  "type": "tree"
                }
              },
              {
                "node": {
                  "name": "functions",
                  "type": "tree"
                }
              },
              {
                "node": {
                  "name": "models",
                  "type": "tree"
                }
              },
              {
                "node": {
                  "name": "tools",
                  "type": "tree"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Fetch a File

This query receives directory path and send the file contents to user in response.

To check this query, create a file `files/data/welcome.txt`
with content of `hello world`.

A sample query and response are given here.

```graphql
query {
  readFile(path: "data/welcome.txt") {
    repository {
      blobs {
        nodes {
          name
          rawBlob
          rawTextBlob
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "readFile": {
      "repository": {
        "blobs": {
          "nodes": [
            {
              "name": "welcome.txt",
              "rawBlob": "hello world",
              "rawTextBlob": "hello world"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Direct HTTP API Calls in lieu of GraphQL API Calls

The lib microservice also supports making API calls using HTTP POST requests.
Simply send a POST request to the URL endpoint with the GraphQL query in
the request body. Make sure to set the Content-Type header to
"application/json".

The easiest way to perform HTTP requests is to use
[HTTPie](https://github.com/httpie/desktop/releases)
desktop application.
You can download the Ubuntu AppImage and run it. Select the following options:

```txt
Method: POST
URL: localhost:4001
Body: <<copy the json code from examples below>>
Content Type: text/json
```

Here are examples of the HTTP requests and responses for the HTTP API calls.

#### Directory listing

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```http
POST /lib HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4001
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 388

{
   "query":"query {\n  listDirectory(path: \".\") {\n    repository {\n      tree {\n        blobs {\n          edges {\n            node {\n              name\n              type\n            }\n          }\n        }\n        trees {\n          edges {\n            node {\n              name\n              type\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}"
}
```

This HTTP POST request will generate the following HTTP response message.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Connection: close
Content-Length: 306
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

```

#### Fetch a file
