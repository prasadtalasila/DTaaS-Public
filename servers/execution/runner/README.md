# Runner

A utility service for the safe execution of remote scripts and commands.
Users launch this from the command line and the utility manages
command execution.

The runner runs as a service and provides a
REST API, and optionally an MQTT API, for safe remote command execution.
Multiple runner instances can be active simultaneously on one machine.
Commands are submitted via the API and executed on the host
running the runner.

Warning: Thanks for trying out this software.
This software is in early stages of development and is not
recommended for production use. Each released package will have
a working API and matching documentation in this README.
However, there will be breaking changes in the API across each release
until the package reaches version 1.0.0.

The runner works on Linux and Windows. On Windows, it runs
the PowerShell version of each script (see [Create Commands](#create-commands)).

## Install

The runner needs Node.js 24 or later.

### NPM Registry

The package is available on
[npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@into-cps-association/runner).

Install the package with the following command:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @into-cps-association/runner
```

### Github Registry

The package is available in Github
[packages registry](https://github.com/orgs/INTO-CPS-Association/packages).

Set the registry and install the package with the following commands

```bash
sudo npm config set @into-cps-association:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
sudo npm install -g @into-cps-association/runner
```

The _npm install_ command asks for username and password. The username is
your Github username and the password is your Github
[personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
In order for the npm to download the package, your personal access token
needs to have _read:packages_ scope.

## Configure

Warning: without an `auth` section, anyone who can reach the runner's
port or its MQTT request topics can run its commands and drive its
state machine. List the callers in an `auth` section
([Access Control](#access-control)) on any network that others share.

The utility requires config specified in YAML format.
A sample configuration is given below. Copy it into a file named
_runner.yaml_, and update the values for your setup:

```yaml
id: 'my-dt' # names the digital twin that this runner serves
port: 5000
location: 'scripts' # directory of scripts, relative to this config file
commands: # list of permitted scripts
  - create
  - execute
  - terminate
```

With this configuration, the scripts are placed in a `scripts` directory
next to _runner.yaml_, and only the _create_, _execute_ and _terminate_
scripts can be run.

`id`, `port`, `location` and `commands` are required. The runner does
not start when one of them is missing, when a value is invalid, or
when _runner.yaml_ has a key that the runner does not know; the error
message names every problem.

Version 0.5.0 made `id` required and replaced the fixed
_state-machine.yaml_ in `location` with the `stateMachine` key (see
[State Machine](#state-machine)). A _runner.yaml_ of an earlier version
needs both changes.

It is suggested that the configuration file be named as _runner.yaml_
and placed in the directory in which the _runner_ microservice is run.

The `location` refers to the relative location of the scripts directory
with respect to the location of _runner.yaml_ file.

However, there is no limitation on either the configuration filename or
the `location`. The path to _runner.yaml_ can either be relative or
absolute path. However, the `location` path is always relative path
with respect to the path of _runner.yaml_ file.

Warning: Ensure that the commands have execute permission
on Linux platforms.

### Digital Twin

The `id` names the digital twin that the runner serves, so that a
Manager can tell runners apart. It has up to 64 letters, digits, `_`,
`.` or `-`, and starts with a letter or digit. Optional `attributes`
describe the digital twin to a Manager:

```yaml
id: 'hospital-1'
attributes: # optional; strings, numbers or booleans
  city: 'Aarhus'
  beds: 120
```

The attributes are a flat map: a value can not be a list or a map.
Their names follow the pattern of `id`. The runner returns `id` and
`attributes` on [GET /dt](#get-request-to-dt).

### Command History

The runner keeps the commands it receives, with their results, in an
SQLite database. The database is in memory unless the configuration
names a database file, relative to the configuration file:

```yaml
database: 'runner.db'
```

With a database file, the history, the status of the last command,
the request keys of [repeated requests](#repeated-requests), the
[state machine](#restarts) and the [parameter values](#parameters)
survive a restart of the runner. No script survives one: a command that
was running when the runner stopped is `interrupted` after the restart.
The runner creates the directory of the database file if needed. Give
each runner a database file of its own.

[GET /history](#get-request-to-history) returns the commands with their
status, exit code, times and caller, and [GET /metrics](#metrics)
counts them by status since the runner started.

Version 0.10.0 made `GET /history` return these records instead of the
names of the commands, with the `since` and `limit` parameters, and
added `GET /metrics`.

### MQTT

The runner serves the same API over MQTT when the configuration
has an `mqtt` section. HTTP remains available on `port`.

```yaml
mqtt:
  url: 'mqtt://localhost:1883' # mqtt://, mqtts://, ws:// or wss://
  topic: 'dtaas/user1/runner' # base topic of this runner
  username: 'runner' # optional
  password: 'secret' # optional
  protocolVersion: 5 # optional; 5 (default) or 4 for MQTT 3.1.1
```

The `topic` must be unique to each runner that shares a broker,
and must not contain the `+` or `#` wildcards.
The runner keeps reconnecting while the broker is unavailable or
refuses the connection, and serves HTTP in the meantime. The runner does not start
if the `mqtt` section is invalid.

### Stop Grace Period

A [stop](#stopping-scripts) sends `SIGTERM` to a script and, if the
script is still running after a grace period, `SIGKILL`. The optional
`stopGrace` sets the period in milliseconds; it is five seconds
without it:

```yaml
stopGrace: 5000
```

### Webhook

The runner posts its [notifications](#notifications) to a webhook
when the configuration has a `notify` section:

```yaml
notify:
  url: 'https://manager.example.org/dt-events' # http:// or https://
  token: 'secret' # optional; sent as Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The runner posts its [presence](#presence) at startup and, at
shutdown, its offline notice once, with a 2 s timeout and no retry, so
that a slow webhook does not hold the shutdown.

### Access Control

With an `auth` section, the runner answers only the callers it lists,
each in a role:

```yaml
auth:
  principals:
    - name: manager-1
      role: manager # manager or client
      publicKey: 'mCpoaytWvGJ9K0lxNlSNw6sjUG7UezRWtxPvL1pyxKA'
    - name: alice
      role: client
      publicKey: 'o-YAagcjoyUxT2xcgULS22sCK6N_cJ-op8Jh7yukXMk'
```

- `name` follows the pattern of `id`, is unique, and is not `script`.
  The section needs one principal at least.
- `publicKey` is an Ed25519 public key as the base64url of its 32 raw
  bytes, the `x` of its JWK. The caller keeps the private key; the file
  holds no secret, and deleting a principal revokes it at the next
  start. The demo's
  [tools/keygen.mjs](demo/hospital/tools/keygen.mjs) writes a key pair.
- Each request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, a token that
  the caller signs for that one request and at most one minute; over
  MQTT the request payload is the token. [API.md](api/API.md#access-control)
  gives the token format and a signing example.
- A `client` may call every route. A `manager` may read, set
  parameters and run the [manager commands](#manager-commands). The
  runner's own scripts call it in the role `script` with the token in
  `RUNNER_TOKEN` (see [Script Environment](#script-environment)): they
  may read, raise events and escalate.
- `GET /health` and MQTT `health` stay open, for liveness probes.
- A request without a valid token gets `401`, and a role that may not
  call the route `403`. The runner logs each accepted request with its
  principal at `debug` level, and stores the principal of each command
  it runs.

Without `auth` every route is open and the runner ignores any
`Authorization` header.

Version 0.9.0 added access control. It changes no route without
`auth`; a database file of an earlier version gains a `by` column for
the principal of each command at the first start.

## Create Commands

The runner requires commands / scripts to be run.
These need to be placed in the `location` specified in
_runner.yaml_ file.

For example, the `location` directory might contain
the two scripts: _create_ and _execute_. These two become
valid command names that consumers of REST API can invoke.
All other command execution requests result in invalid status.

On Windows, each command needs a PowerShell script with the `.ps1`
extension, for example _create.ps1_ for the _create_ command.
The runner executes it with `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File`.
A directory can hold both versions of a script, so that the same
commands work on Linux and Windows.

A command request may carry an `input` object (see
[POST /](#post-request-to-)). The script reads it from stdin as one
line of JSON followed by a newline; nothing is passed on the command
line. Without input, and for the scripts that the
[state machine](#state-machine) starts, stdin is empty and closed, so a
script that reads stdin never waits. For example, `cat` in a shell
script or `[Console]::In.ReadToEnd()` in a PowerShell script reads the
whole input. Windows PowerShell decodes stdin in the console code page,
so a PowerShell script may garble input that is not ASCII.

The runner does not store the input, as it may hold personal data. It
does store the output of each script, so a script that prints its
input puts it in the [command history](#command-history).

### Script Environment

Each script inherits the environment of the runner, and the runner adds
its own variables:

| Variable          | Value                                                             |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RUNNER_URL`      | `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, the runner's own HTTP API              |
| `RUNNER_TOKEN`    | the bearer token of the scripts, with [auth](#access-control)     |
| `DT_ID`           | `id` of _runner.yaml_                                             |
| `DT_STATE`        | the state of the [state machine](#state-machine), as below        |
| `DT_ENTRY`        | the entry number of that state, as below                          |
| `DT_PARAM_<NAME>` | the value of each [parameter](#parameters) when the script starts |

For a script that the state machine runs, `DT_STATE` and `DT_ENTRY`
name the state it enters and the number of that entry. For a script of
`POST /` they name the current state and entry, or are empty and `0`
before the first transition. Without a state machine a script gets
only `RUNNER_URL` and `DT_ID`. `RUNNER_URL` uses the port that the
runner listens on. `RUNNER_TOKEN` is drawn anew at each start and is
unset without an `auth` section. The state machine file may
[declare more variables](#declared-environment).

The `DOCKER.md` file in the
[runner source](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/DTaaS/tree/feature/distributed-demo/servers/execution/runner)
describes running the runner in a docker container.

## State Machine

[STATE-MACHINE.md](STATE-MACHINE.md) is a guide to writing and running
a state machine, with two worked examples.

A state machine moves a digital twin from one script to the next.
The user starts it with a transition to a script, and from then on
events and the exit of each script decide which script runs next.
The state machine of a digital twin is in a file that the
`stateMachine` key of _runner.yaml_ names. A relative path is relative
to _runner.yaml_, and an absolute path works too:

```yaml
stateMachine: 'scripts/state-machine.yaml'
```

The file holds the events and the states, and may declare
[parameters](#parameters), an [environment](#declared-environment)
and the conditions that [escalate](#escalation):

```yaml
events: # the events that clients may send
  - stop
  - reset
states: # each state runs the script of the same name
  create:
    transitions:
      $success: execute # when the create script succeeds
      $failure: terminate # when the create script fails
  execute:
    transitions:
      stop: terminate # when a client sends the stop event
  terminate:
    transitions:
      reset: create
```

- Each state is a script, and must be one of the `commands` of
  _runner.yaml_. Entering a state runs its script.
- `transitions` gives the next state for each event of a state.
- `events` lists the events that clients may send. It may be left out
  when only the completion events move the machine.
- A state without transitions may be left empty, as in `terminate:`.
- The runner raises the completion events itself when the script of
  the current state exits: `$success`, `$failure`, or `$stopped` when
  the runner [stopped](#stopping-scripts) it. Clients can not send
  them.
- A transition may stop the script of the state that the machine
  leaves, as described in [stopping scripts](#stopping-scripts).
- State and event names have up to 64 letters, digits, `_`, `.` or
  `-`, and start with a letter or digit.

The runner does not start if the file is invalid, for example when a
state is not a permitted command, a transition leads to an undeclared
state or uses an undeclared event, or `$success` and `$failure`
transitions alone form a loop, or if the file does not exist. Without
the `stateMachine` key, the state machine is off. The runner reads the
file when it starts.

A plain transition does not stop the script of the state that the
machine leaves; the script of the next state, such as _terminate_, has
to do that, unless the transition has `stop: true`. Nor does the runner
enter a state whose script is still running: a completion transition
into such a state is skipped with a warning in the log, and the machine
stays idle in its state.

A transition request waits until the machine is idle, so give each
state whose script may run long an event that leads out of it, as
_execute_ has `stop` above. Otherwise only a
[stop request](#post-request-to-stop) moves the machine while that
script hangs, and only when the state has no `$stopped` transition;
with one, the machine moves on and is busy again.

### Stopping Scripts

The runner stops a script on a [stop request](#post-request-to-stop)
and on a transition with `stop: true`. It sends `SIGTERM` and, if the
script still runs after the [grace period](#stop-grace-period),
`SIGKILL`. A script that the runner stopped is `stopped` in the
history and in `GET /`; a script killed from outside the runner has
failed.

When the runner stops the script of the current state, it raises
`$stopped`. A state without a `$stopped` transition stays idle in that
state, with the script status `stopped`. A loop through `$stopped` is
allowed, as it needs a stop request each time.

A transition stops the script of the state that the machine leaves
when its value names the next state and `stop: true`:

```yaml
events:
  - restart
  - stop
states:
  execute:
    transitions:
      restart: { state: execute, stop: true } # restarts the script
      stop: { state: terminate, stop: true }
  terminate:
```

On such an event the runner enters the next state at once and answers
`accepted`, then stops the script of the state it left, waits until
that script has exited, and runs the script of the next state. The
stopped script raises no `$stopped`, as the machine has left its
state. A transition to the same state thus restarts its script, which
a plain transition refuses while the script runs. A transition to
another state whose script runs is refused with `script running`.
`stop: true` is not allowed on `$success`, `$failure` and `$stopped`,
whose script has already exited.

Scripts must let a stop end them:

- The runner waits until the stdout and stderr of a script close. A
  child process that keeps them open, such as a foreground `sleep`
  under `sh`, which survives the `SIGTERM` of its shell, holds up the
  stop until it exits. End such children on `SIGTERM`, for example by
  starting the last command with `exec`, or with a `trap`.
- On Windows, the runner ends `powershell.exe` at once, without a
  grace period, and the processes that the script started keep
  running.

### Restarts

The runner stores the state, the entry counter and the status of the
script in its [database](#command-history) at each entry and each
script exit, and resumes them when it starts again. With the database
in memory, a restarted runner has no state until the next transition
request.

- A state whose script was running when the runner stopped comes back
  with the status `interrupted`. The runner does not run that script
  again; the machine is idle, so a transition request or an event moves
  it on.
- A script that exits while the runner shuts down keeps its status, but
  the runner does not follow its completion transition.
- A stored state that the state machine file no longer has is dropped
  with a warning in the log, and the machine starts without a state.
  The entry counter is kept, so entry numbers never repeat.
- Without the `stateMachine` key, the runner logs the stored state and
  keeps it for a later start with the state machine.

Version 0.8.0 added the restore and the status `interrupted`; a runner
of an earlier version always started without a state.

### Parameters

The state machine file may also declare parameters: settings of the
digital twin that a Manager can read and, where the DT author allows
it, change.

```yaml
events:
  - restart
  - scope-changed
parameters:
  scope:
    type: enum
    values: [single, multi]
    default: single
    controllable: true # a Manager may change it
    event: scope-changed # raised when the value changes
  capacity:
    type: number
    default: 20
    controllable: false
states:
  create:
    transitions:
      $success: execute
  execute:
    transitions:
      restart: create
      scope-changed: { state: execute, stop: true }
```

- `type` is `string`, `number`, `boolean` or `enum`. An `enum` has
  `values`, a non-empty list of strings.
- `default` is required and must have the type of the parameter; the
  default of an `enum` must be one of its `values`. YAML reads `20` as
  a number, so a `string` parameter needs quotes, as in `'20'`. A
  `number` parameter refuses `"20"`, a string, and `.inf` and `.nan`.
- `controllable` is `false` unless given. Only controllable parameters
  can be [set over the API](#parameters-requests); the others are
  configuration that the digital twin shares with a Manager.
- `event`, if given, must be in `events`. The runner raises it when a
  request changes the value.
- Parameter names follow the rules of state and event names. Two names
  that differ only in case or in `.`, `-` and `_`, such as `a-b` and
  `A_B`, are refused, as both become the variable name `DT_PARAM_A_B`.

The runner never restarts a script on its own. A script that is
running keeps the values it started with. A DT author who wants a
change to take effect at once links the parameter to an event whose
transition restarts the script, as `scope-changed` does above with a
self-transition and `stop: true`.

The runner records each change, with its time, in its
[database](#command-history), and restores the latest values when it
starts again. A stored value of a parameter that is no longer declared,
or that no longer fits its declaration, such as a removed enum value,
is dropped with a warning in the log, and the parameter starts at its
default. A restored value raises no event.

### Declared Environment

The state machine file may add variables to the
[script environment](#script-environment), for every script and for
the script of one state:

```yaml
env:
  LOG_LEVEL: info
  HINT: '${DT_ID}-${DT_PARAM_SCOPE}'
states:
  monitor:
    env:
      INTERVAL: 5
    transitions:
      stop: idle
```

- Names have upper-case letters, digits and `_`, start with a letter,
  and may not start with `DT_` or `RUNNER_`. Values are strings,
  numbers or booleans; the script reads them as strings.
- A value may use `${NAME}` for `RUNNER_URL`, `RUNNER_TOKEN`, `DT_ID`,
  `DT_STATE`, `DT_ENTRY` or the `DT_PARAM_` variable of a declared parameter. Any
  other name, such as another declared variable or a variable of the
  runner's own environment, stops the runner at startup, so the file
  means the same on every host. There is no escape for a literal `${`.
- Later wins: the runner's environment, the runner variables, the
  `env` of the file, the `env` of the state. A script of `POST /` gets
  the `env` of its command when the command is a state, even another
  state than the current one, which `DT_STATE` still names.
- On Windows, where names ignore case, a variable of the runner's
  environment such as `Path` gives way to a declared `PATH`.

### Raising Events From Scripts

A script raises a declared event as any client does, over HTTP:
`POST ${RUNNER_URL}/fsm/event` with `{ "event": "<name>" }`,
`Content-Type: application/json` and
`Authorization: Bearer ${RUNNER_TOKEN}`. The runner ignores the header
without [access control](#access-control), so a script may always send
it. The reply tells the script:

| Reply                                                                | For the script                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `202` `accepted`                                                     | its state is being left: the next state's script starts, and the exit of this one no longer moves the machine; with `stop: true` on the transition, `SIGTERM` follows |
| `400` `invalid event`, `Validation Failed`, `404` `no state machine` | a bug in the script or the state machine file; a retry does not help                                                                                                  |
| `409` `no transition`, `script running`                              | not now: the current state has no transition for the event, or the next state's script still runs                                                                     |
| `503` `stopping`                                                     | the runner is shutting down; the script should exit                                                                                                                   |

A shell script with `curl`; the code is `000` when the runner can not
be reached:

```sh
code=$(curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUNNER_TOKEN" -d '{"event": "done"}' \
  "$RUNNER_URL/fsm/event")
case "$code" in
  202 | 503) exit 0 ;;
  409) echo "not now" ;;
  *) echo "event refused: $code" >&2 && exit 1 ;;
esac
```

The runner's container image has neither `curl` nor `wget`
([DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md)). A script that runs in it uses `node`, which
prints `0` when the runner can not be reached:

```sh
code=$(node -e "fetch(process.env.RUNNER_URL + '/fsm/event', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer ' + (process.env.RUNNER_TOKEN ?? ''),
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ event: 'done' }),
}).then((reply) => console.log(reply.status), () => console.log(0))")
```

The runner starts a `.ps1` script with Windows PowerShell 5.1, whose
`Invoke-RestMethod` throws on a `4xx` or `5xx` reply and has no
`-SkipHttpErrorCheck`. `202` is the only success of the route, and
`$code` is `0` when the runner can not be reached:

```powershell
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $env:RUNNER_TOKEN" }
try {
  Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$env:RUNNER_URL/fsm/event" `
    -Headers $headers -ContentType 'application/json' `
    -Body '{"event": "done"}' | Out-Null
  $code = 202
} catch { $code = [int]$_.Exception.Response.StatusCode }
```

A script reads the current parameter values with
`GET ${RUNNER_URL}/parameters`; its `DT_PARAM_` variables keep the
values it started with.

### Escalation

A digital twin escalates to its Manager when it can not adapt by
itself any more, or wants a shared setting changed. The runner can not
judge that, so the DT author declares which conditions the runner
escalates by itself, and scripts or other clients can
[ask for an escalation](#escalation-requests) at any time:

```yaml
escalation:
  # the script of a state failed and the state has no $failure transition
  onFailure: true
  # a client event has no transition in the current state
  onNoTransition: true
```

- The section is optional, and both flags are `false` unless given;
  without them, only requests escalate. An unknown key or a value
  that is not a boolean stops the runner at startup.
- `onFailure`: the script of the current state ends `failed` and the
  state has no `$failure` transition. A `$failure` transition that the
  runner skips, as its state's script is still running, does not
  escalate, nor does a stopped script or `$success`.
- `onNoTransition`: a client event, over `POST /fsm/event` or MQTT,
  from a script too, gets `409 no transition` after the first
  transition. The runner escalates each event once per entry into a
  state, so a client that repeats an event does not flood the
  Manager. An invalid event, a request refused while the runner
  stops, and an event that a [parameter](#parameters) raises do not
  escalate.

The runner sends each escalation as a
[notification](#notifications) of kind `escalation`. An escalation
raises no event and does not change the state.

### Manager Commands

The state machine file may list the commands that a Manager of a
network of digital twins may submit:

```yaml
manager:
  commands:
    - admit
```

Each must be one of the `commands` of _runner.yaml_, or the runner does
not start. The list appears on [GET /dt](#get-request-to-dt); it is
empty without a state machine, without a `manager` section, or for a
bare `manager:` key. With [access control](#access-control), a
principal in the role `manager` may run only these commands and gets
`403` for any other; a `client` may run every permitted command.
Without access control the list is not enforced.

## Use

Display help.

```bash
$runner -h
Usage: runner [options]

Remote code execution for humans

Options:
  -c --config <string>  runner config file specified in yaml format (default: "runner.yaml")
  -h --help             display help
```

The config option is not mandatory. If it is not used, **runner** looks for
_runner.yaml_ in the directory from which it is being run.
Once launched, the utility runs at the port specified in
_runner.yaml_ file.

```bash
runner  #use runner.yaml of the present working directory
runner -c FILE-PATH       #absolute or relative path to config file
runner --config FILE-PATH #absolute or relative path to config file
```

If launched on one computer,
you can access the same at `http://localhost:<port>`.

Access to the service on network is available at `http://<ip or hostname>:<port>/`.

### Application Programming Interface (API)

[API.md](api/API.md) is the full reference of the HTTP and MQTT APIs and of
the notifications, with examples from the
[hospital demo](demo/hospital/README.md).

Four REST API methods run and stop commands, three more drive the
[state machine](#state-machine-requests), one
[describes the digital twin](#get-request-to-dt), one returns
[its state](#get-request-to-state), one
[escalates to the Manager](#escalation-requests) and one returns
[metrics](#metrics). The routes for
commands and their responses are:

| REST API Route          | HTTP Method | Return Value                                                            | Comment                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| localhost:port          | POST        | Returns the execution status of command                                 | Executes the command provided. All the commands sent in the right JSON format gets stored in _history_. |
| localhost:port          | GET         | Returns the execution status of the last command sent via POST request. |                                                                                                         |
| localhost:port/history  | GET         | Returns the commands received, with their status and times.             |                                                                                                         |
| localhost:port/stop     | POST        | Returns the names of the stopped commands                               | Stops one running command, or all of them.                                                              |
| localhost:port/escalate | POST        | Returns `{"status": "accepted"}`                                        | Escalates to the Manager, as described in [escalation requests](#escalation-requests).                  |
| localhost:port/metrics  | GET         | Returns counters since the runner started                               | Described in [metrics](#metrics).                                                                       |

#### POST Request to /

Executes a command. The command name given here must exist
in _location_ directory. The optional `input` is a JSON object that
the script reads from stdin, as described in
[create commands](#create-commands):

```http
{
  "name": "<command name>",
  "input": { "patient": "p-17", "ward": "B" }
}
```

`input` may be `{}` but not a list, a string or `null`, nor have a
`__proto__` key, and its JSON may be at most 64 KiB (65 536 bytes); any
other `input` gets the validation error below. A request body over
100 kB is refused with HTTP status 413 before that check, by the JSON
parser of the HTTP server.

The response tells how the command ended, with its result:

```http
{
  "status": "failed",
  "result": { "exitCode": 3, "stdout": "", "stderr": "no free bed" }
}
```

| Status            | HTTP Status | Meaning                                                                   |
| :---------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `success`         | 200         | the script exited with 0                                                  |
| `failed`          | 200         | a permitted script exited with another code, was killed, or did not start |
| `stopped`         | 200         | a [stop request](#post-request-to-stop) stopped the script                |
| `invalid command` | 400         | the command is not permitted, or the request key is of another command    |
| `command running` | 409         | the request has `input` and the command is already running                |

`result` comes with `success`, `failed` and `stopped`, and holds the
logs of the script whatever its outcome. `exitCode` is `null` for a
stopped script. On Linux it is also `null` for a script that could not
start or was killed by a signal. On Windows, a missing script is
reported with the exit code of `powershell.exe`, and a script killed
from outside with 1.

Version 0.7.0 added `input`, `result` and the `failed` status; before
it, a script that failed was answered `invalid command` with HTTP
status 400. Versions before 0.6.0 could not stop a command and had no
`stopped` response.

#### GET Request to /

Shows the status of the command last executed, with its logs and exit
code:

```http
{
  "name": "<command-name>",
  "status": "valid",
  "logs": {
    "stdout": "<output log of command>",
    "stderr": "<error log of command>"
  },
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

The status is `valid` for a script that succeeded, `failed` for one
that failed, `stopped` for one that a stop request stopped,
`interrupted` for one that was running when the runner stopped (see
[Command History](#command-history)), and `invalid` for a command that
is not permitted, whose logs are empty and whose `exitCode` is `null`.
Before the first command, the name is `none` and the status `invalid`.

If an incorrectly formatted JSON is sent via POST request,
a validation error is returned.

```http
{
  "message": "Validation Failed",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```

#### GET Request to /history

Returns the commands received, oldest first, both valid and invalid
ones; a repeated request is not recorded again. Each record has the
status, exit code and times of the command, and the principal that
sent it (see [Access Control](#access-control)), or `null`:

```http
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "create",
    "status": "valid",
    "exitCode": 0,
    "receivedAt": "2026-10-26T14:55:51.000Z",
    "finishedAt": "2026-10-26T14:55:52.000Z",
    "by": null
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "execute",
    "status": "running",
    "exitCode": null,
    "receivedAt": "2026-10-26T14:55:59.000Z",
    "finishedAt": null,
    "by": "alice"
  }
]
```

The status is `running` until the command finishes, then as
[GET /](#get-request-to-), and the logs stay on `GET /`. Two optional
query parameters select the records:

- `since`, an ISO 8601 time with `Z` or an offset: the records received
  at that second or later, as times are stored to the second. In a URL,
  write the `+` of an offset as `%2B`, as in
  `since=2026-10-26T16:56:00%2B02:00`; a plain `+` arrives as a space,
  and the request is refused with `400`.
- `limit`, from 1 to 1000, by default 100: the newest records of the
  selection, still oldest first.

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:5000/history?since=2026-10-26T14:56:00Z&limit=2'
```

Any other value of either gets the validation error.

#### GET Request to /dt

Describes the digital twin that the runner serves, from its
[configuration](#digital-twin):

```http
{
  "id": "hospital-1",
  "attributes": { "city": "Aarhus", "beds": 120 },
  "commands": ["create", "execute"],
  "stateMachine": true,
  "manager": { "commands": ["execute"] }
}
```

`attributes` is `{}` when _runner.yaml_ has none, `commands` lists the
permitted commands, `stateMachine` tells whether a state machine
is loaded, and `manager` lists the
[manager commands](#manager-commands).

#### GET Request to /state

Returns the state of the digital twin in one document, with HTTP
status 200 whether or not a state machine is loaded:

```http
{
  "id": "hospital-1",
  "time": "2026-10-25T10:00:00.000Z",
  "machine": {
    "state": "execute",
    "status": "running",
    "entry": 3,
    "events": ["restart"]
  },
  "parameters": {},
  "command": {
    "name": "execute",
    "status": "running",
    "receivedAt": "2026-10-25T09:59:58.000Z",
    "finishedAt": null
  }
}
```

- `id` is the [identity](#digital-twin) of the digital twin, and
  `time` the time of the document.
- `machine` is the body of [GET /fsm](#state-machine-requests), or
  `null` without a state machine.
- `parameters` holds the value of each [parameter](#parameters), and
  is `{}` without a state machine.
- `command` is the latest command, or `null` before the first one. Its
  `status` is `running` until it finishes, and then `valid`, `failed`,
  `invalid`, `stopped` or `interrupted` as in
  [GET /](#get-request-to-), with `finishedAt` set.
  The logs stay on `GET /`. The latest command may be one of `POST /`
  while the script of the state machine runs; `machine.status` tells
  the status of that script.

The times are in ISO 8601 UTC.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/state
```

#### POST Request to /stop

Stops the running command of the given name:

```http
{
  "name": "<command name>"
}
```

Without a `name`, or without a request body, it stops every running
command. The runner stops each one as described in
[stopping scripts](#stopping-scripts), and answers with HTTP status 200
once they have exited, which can take the grace period and more:

```http
{
  "stopped": ["<command name>"]
}
```

The list is empty when nothing was running. The response does not wait
for the state machine to follow `$stopped`, so `GET /fsm` straight
after it may still show the old state for a moment. A request key is
not needed: a repeated stop request finds nothing running.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/stop
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/stop \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "execute"}'
```

#### Repeated Requests

The runner does not run a command again for a repeated request:

- A request may carry an `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header, or an
  `idempotency-key` user property over MQTT 5, with a value of up to
  255 characters unique to that request. A later request with the same
  key gets the response of the first one, and the command does not
  run again, whatever the `input` of the repeat. A request whose key
  belongs to another command is refused as an invalid command.
- A request for a command that is still running gets the result of
  that run, and does not start the command a second time. A request
  with `input` is refused instead with `command running` and HTTP
  status 409, as the run in progress did not get that input; it is not
  added to the history, and its key is not kept.

A repeated request is not added to the history. The runner keeps the
history, the logs and the request keys in its
[database](#command-history) without a time limit. A command that was
running when the runner stopped is `interrupted` after the restart, and
a repeat of its request gets `failed` with `exitCode` `null`. A repeat
of a request whose command a stop request stopped gets `stopped`, as
does a request that joined that run.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 7d1e4a36-0b8a-4c51-9c0e-2b8f1e6f2a10' \
  -d '{"name": "create"}'
```

#### State Machine Requests

Three more routes drive the [state machine](#state-machine).

| REST API Route                | HTTP Method | Request Body          | Comment                          |
| :---------------------------- | :---------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| localhost:port/fsm/transition | POST        | `{"state": "create"}` | Moves an idle machine to a state |
| localhost:port/fsm/event      | POST        | `{"event": "stop"}`   | Sends an event to the machine    |
| localhost:port/fsm            | GET         |                       | Returns the state of the machine |

The machine is idle before its first transition and whenever the
script of its current state has finished. An event moves the machine
along the transition of its current state for that event, even while
the script of that state runs. The runner answers a transition or an
event as soon as the script of the new state has started:

```http
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "state": "terminate"
}
```

The `status` tells the outcome, and `state` the state of the machine
after the request, or `null` before the first transition.

| Status                | HTTP Status | Meaning                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `accepted`            | 202         | the machine entered the state and started its script    |
| `invalid state`       | 400         | the state is not in the state machine file              |
| `invalid event`       | 400         | the event is not in `events`                            |
| `invalid request key` | 400         | the request key belongs to another request              |
| `busy`                | 409         | a transition request while the script of the state runs |
| `no transition`       | 409         | the current state has no transition for the event       |
| `script running`      | 409         | the script of the next state is still running           |
| `no state machine`    | 404         | _runner.yaml_ has no `stateMachine`                     |
| `stopping`            | 503         | the runner is shutting down                             |

A request body without a `state` or `event` gets the validation error
of `POST /`, before any other check. A transition or event request may
carry an `Idempotency-Key`. The runner gives a repeat of an accepted
request the reply to the first one, for the latest 256 keys; a refused
request changed nothing, so its repeat is checked again. These keys are
kept in memory, apart from the keys of `POST /`. An older key is
forgotten, and a repeat of it counts as a new request.

`GET /fsm` returns the state, the status of its script (`none`,
`running`, `valid`, `invalid`, `stopped` or `interrupted` after a
[restart](#restarts)), the number of entries
into states so far, and the events of the digital twin:

```http
{
  "state": "execute",
  "status": "running",
  "entry": 3,
  "events": ["reset", "stop"]
}
```

`entry` is `0` before the first transition. It tells two entries into
the same state apart, such as a restart of its script.

The scripts that the machine runs appear in the _history_ and in
`GET /` like any other command.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/fsm/transition \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"state": "create"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/fsm/event \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"event": "stop"}'
```

#### Parameters Requests

Two routes read and set the [parameters](#parameters).

| REST API Route            | HTTP Method | Request Body         | Comment                                    |
| :------------------------ | :---------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| localhost:port/parameters | GET         |                      | Returns the parameters and their values    |
| localhost:port/parameters | PUT         | `{"scope": "multi"}` | Sets the values of controllable parameters |

`GET /parameters` returns the value and the declaration of each
parameter, without its `event`:

```http
{
  "scope": {
    "value": "multi",
    "type": "enum",
    "values": ["single", "multi"],
    "default": "single",
    "controllable": true
  },
  "capacity": {
    "value": 20,
    "type": "number",
    "default": 20,
    "controllable": false
  }
}
```

Without a state machine, both routes answer `404` with the body of
`GET /fsm`, `{"status": "no state machine", "state": null}`.

The body of `PUT /parameters` maps parameter names to new values,
which are strings, numbers or booleans. The runner applies the whole
body or none of it:

1. It checks every entry. An unknown name, a parameter that is not
   controllable or a value of the wrong type is refused with `400`,
   and `message` lists every problem:

   ```http
   {
     "message": [
       "parameter capacity is not controllable",
       "parameter size is not declared"
     ],
     "error": "Bad Request",
     "statusCode": 400
   }
   ```

1. It stores the new values, all of them or, if the database fails,
   none, so that a script that starts afterwards sees them.
1. It raises the `event` of each changed parameter, in the order of the
   declarations, each in the state that the one before left. An event
   that two changed parameters declare is raised once.

The reply is then `200` with the body of `GET /parameters`, whatever
the events did; `GET /state` tells where the machine went, and shows
the new values under `parameters`. An event that
the machine refuses is logged. A value equal to the current one changes
nothing and raises no event, so a repeated request and `{}` change
nothing, and the route takes no `Idempotency-Key`. A body that is not
an object of such values gets the validation error of `POST /`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/parameters
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/parameters   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"scope": "multi"}'
```

#### Escalation Requests

`POST /escalate` sends an [escalation](#escalation) to the Manager,
for example from a script that finds that the digital twin can not
cope:

```json
{ "reason": "capacity", "proposal": { "scope": "multi" } }
```

- `reason` is required: a non-empty string of up to 1 KiB.
- `proposal` is optional: a JSON object of up to 4 KiB, by convention
  the parameter values that the digital twin would like. The runner
  passes it on as it was received and does not read it.
- Each size is that of the value as JSON text, in bytes of UTF-8,
  quotes included.

The runner answers `202` with `{"status": "accepted"}`, with or without
a state machine, so that a digital twin without one can escalate too.
Any other body gets the validation error of `POST /`. Once the runner
has begun to stop, it still answers `202` but sends nothing.

A request may carry an `Idempotency-Key`, as in
[repeated requests](#repeated-requests). The keys of escalations are
apart from those of the other routes, and every escalation counts as
the same request, so a repeated key gets the first reply and escalates
nothing, even with another body. The runner keeps the last 256 keys in
memory.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/escalate   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -H 'Idempotency-Key: 3f2b9c4e'   -d '{"reason": "capacity", "proposal": {"scope": "multi"}}'
```

#### Health

`GET /health` tells whether the runner answers and whether its
connections are up. It is a liveness check only: it does not tell
whether the digital twin does its job.

```http
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 3724,
  "mqtt": "connected",
  "database": "file"
}
```

- `uptime` is the number of whole seconds since the runner started.
- `mqtt` is `connected`, `disconnected` while the runner is not
  connected to its broker, including while it reconnects, or `disabled`
  without an `mqtt` section in the configuration.
- `database` is `file` with a [database file](#command-history), else
  `memory`.
- `status` is `degraded` while `mqtt` is `disconnected`, else `ok`.

The runner answers `200` in both cases. It connects to the broker after
it starts, so the first replies may say `degraded`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

#### Metrics

`GET /metrics` counts what the runner did since it started: the
commands by status, and with a state machine the entries into each
state, the seconds spent there, the scripts that finished, and the
transition and event requests; and the escalations by trigger.

```http
{
  "since": "2026-10-26T14:55:41.402Z",
  "uptime": 42,
  "commands": {
    "valid": 6,
    "failed": 2,
    "stopped": 1,
    "invalid": 0,
    "interrupted": 0,
    "running": 1
  },
  "machine": {
    "entries": { "open": 3, "full": 1 },
    "seconds": { "open": 34.4, "full": 4.6 },
    "completions": { "$success": 0, "$failure": 1, "$stopped": 0 },
    "transitions": { "requested": 1, "accepted": 1 },
    "events": { "requested": 5, "accepted": 3, "noTransition": 2 }
  },
  "escalations": { "request": 1, "failure": 1, "no-transition": 1 }
}
```

`machine` is `null` without a state machine. The counters live in
memory, so a restart, which `since` shows, sets them back to zero; they
are not part of the state document and send no notification.
[API.md](api/API.md#get-metrics) describes each field.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics
```

### MQTT API

With MQTT enabled, the runner subscribes to one request topic
for each REST API route. A request and its response carry the same
JSON as the matching HTTP request and response.

| Request Topic            | Matching HTTP Request | Request Payload                            |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `<topic>/execute`        | POST /                | `{"name": "<command name>", "input": {}}`  |

The runner also publishes [notifications](#notifications) under
`<topic>/notify/<kind>`, among them its [presence](#presence) on
`<topic>/notify/presence`, which is also the topic of its MQTT will.

The runner answers a `health` request only while it is connected, so
the reply always says `"mqtt": "connected"`; that a reply arrives at
all tells that the runner is alive.

The runner publishes each response with QoS 1:

- to the response topic of an MQTT 5 request, along with its
  correlation data, when the request has a response topic;
- otherwise to the request topic followed by `/response`,
  for example `<topic>/execute/response`.

The runner uses the default response topic instead when the
requested one is empty, holds a wildcard, starts with `$`,
or is one of its request topics.

MQTT has no status codes, so the response payload alone tells
the outcome. An `execute` payload has no 100 kB limit, but its `input`
has the 64 KiB limit of `POST /`. A request payload that is not a JSON
object with a `name` gets the validation error of the HTTP API, and an
unexpected failure gets the body of an HTTP 500 response. A stop
request may have an empty payload, or `{}`, to stop every running
command.

The runner subscribes with QoS 1, so the broker may deliver a request
twice. An MQTT 5 request with an `idempotency-key` user property runs
once, as described in [repeated requests](#repeated-requests); MQTT
3.1.1 has no user properties. Requests published while the runner is
disconnected are lost, and the runner ignores retained requests,
so that a command does not run again each time the runner connects.

Every client subscribed to `<topic>/<route>/response` receives every
response on it. A client that must tell its own responses apart
should connect with MQTT 5 and give a response topic of its own.

The commands below use the
[Mosquitto clients](https://mosquitto.org/download/)
to run the _create_ command and wait for its response.

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'dtaas/user1/runner/+/response' &
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t 'dtaas/user1/runner/execute' \
  -m '{"name": "create"}'
# MQTT 5, with a request key
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -V mqttv5 -t 'dtaas/user1/runner/execute' \
  -D publish user-property idempotency-key 7d1e4a36 \
  -m '{"name": "create"}'
```

With an [auth section](#access-control), the payload of each request
but `health` is a signed token that holds the request topic and the
JSON above as its `body`; a plain payload gets the `401` body of the
HTTP API, and a refused role the `403` body, on the response topic.
[API.md](api/API.md#mqtt-access-control) describes the envelope.

Without it, anyone who can publish to the request topics can run the
permitted commands. Either way, use the access control of the broker
as the outer wall: `auth` decides who may act, the broker who may
publish on the request topics and read the responses and
notifications at all, and which topics the runner may publish to. Use
`mqtts://` or `wss://` with a username and password when the broker is
not on the same computer.

### Notifications

The runner sends its [state document](#get-request-to-state) whenever
the document changes: when the state machine enters a state, when the
script of a state finishes, when a command starts or finishes, and once
at startup. A document that differs from the last one sent only in its
`time` is not sent again. Each notification is one JSON object:

```json
{
  "kind": "state",
  "id": "hospital-1",
  "time": "2026-10-25T10:00:00.000Z",
  "data": { "id": "hospital-1", "time": "2026-10-25T10:00:00.000Z" }
}
```

`data` is the whole state document, shortened here; `id` and `time` are
those of the document. Documents built within the same millisecond can
share `time`.

`kind` is `state` for a state document, `presence` for the notices of
[presence](#presence), or `escalation` for an
[escalation](#escalation):

```json
{
  "kind": "escalation",
  "id": "hospital-1",
  "time": "2026-10-25T10:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "trigger": "request",
    "state": "execute",
    "entry": 3,
    "event": null,
    "reason": "capacity",
    "proposal": { "scope": "multi" }
  }
}
```

- `trigger` is `failure` (`onFailure`), `no-transition`
  (`onNoTransition`) or `request` (`POST /escalate`).
- `state` and `entry` are those of the machine when the escalation
  happened; `null` and `0` without a machine or before its first
  transition.
- `event` names the client event of a `no-transition`, else `null`.
- `reason` is that of the request, or the runner's own text, such as
  `script of state execute failed` or
  `no transition for restart in state execute`. `proposal` is that of
  the request, else `null`.

With MQTT enabled, the runner publishes each notification with QoS 1 on
`<topic>/notify/<kind>`, for example `<topic>/notify/state`. A state
notification is retained, so that a Manager that subscribes later
receives the current state at once; an escalation is not, so that a
Manager that subscribes later does not act on an old one. The
notification topics are two levels under the base topic, so
`<topic>/+/response` does not match them; subscribe to
`<topic>/notify/+` instead. While the broker is unreachable, the runner
queues the notifications in memory and publishes them in order when it
connects again; a long outage holds every queued document in memory.

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t 'dtaas/user1/runner/notify/+'
```

With a [webhook](#webhook), the runner posts each notification as
`application/json`, with a 5 s timeout. It retries after 1 s, 2 s and
4 s on a network error, a timeout or a `5xx` response, and not on any
other response. Posts are independent, so they may arrive out of
order; a receiver that needs a strict order uses MQTT, which delivers
the notifications in order. A failure is logged
once, with the host of the webhook only, until a post succeeds again.
At shutdown, the runner abandons the posts still in progress or waiting
for a retry, and posts only its offline notice.

Without MQTT and a webhook, [GET /state](#get-request-to-state) is the
only way to observe the state.

#### Presence

The runner announces that it joins and leaves, with notifications of
kind `presence`. The online notice carries the
[descriptor](#get-request-to-dt) of the DT:

```json
{
  "kind": "presence",
  "id": "hospital-1",
  "time": "2026-10-25T10:00:00.000Z",
  "data": { "online": true, "descriptor": { "id": "hospital-1" } }
}
```

The offline notice has `"data": { "online": false }` and the time the
runner left.

With MQTT enabled, the runner publishes the online notice on
`<topic>/notify/presence`, retained, each time it connects to the
broker, the first time and after each reconnect. It connects with a
will on the same topic: the offline notice, retained, with
`"time": null`, as the will is fixed when the runner connects. The
broker publishes the will only when the runner disappears without
leaving: a crash, a kill or a lost connection. The will is the one
notification without a time.

At shutdown the runner leaves the broker in steps of at most 2 s each:

1. It publishes the offline notice, retained, with the current time.
1. Once the broker acknowledged the notice, or the publish failed, the
   runner disconnects gracefully, so that the broker drops the will.
1. Otherwise, or if the disconnect does not finish, it closes the
   connection and logs a warning that the broker did not confirm the
   leave. The broker may then publish the will, which replaces the
   retained notice with one without a time; it still says offline.

Leaving the broker thus adds at most 4 s to the shutdown.

With a [webhook](#webhook), the runner posts the online notice once at
startup, not on a reconnect, and the offline notice once at shutdown.
Without MQTT and a webhook, nothing is announced.
